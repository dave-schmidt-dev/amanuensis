    atoms already filed under the snapshot. Idempotent re-snapshot
    (semantically equal ``Vocabulary.model_dump()``) succeeds; differing

    Symmetric with ``SubstrateSnapshotConflict`` (INV-10 vocabulary pin):
    a source-mirror distillation is write-once. Re-ingesting the same
    source_id with a shorter PDF would leave orphan ``p-NNNN.md`` files
